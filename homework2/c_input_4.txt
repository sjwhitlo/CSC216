You're not expected to handle other special syntax
that might compilcate parsing of comments.  For example
// you wouldn't consider this a comment.

You don't have to worry about /* nesting /* comments */ like
this */ (although we could). Your program would just consider this
to be one comment ending right before the word "like".

You're not expected to give special treatment to things like
strings.  So, for example "You would /* still consider" this to
be a comment */ even though a C compiler wouldn't.

Just like C, this /*/ isn't a valid comment.  Really, it's just
the start of a comment.  I have to end it with */ if I want this
to be a valid input file.
